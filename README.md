# Baby-Cardiac-Arrest-Detection-Using-ML
This project uses machine learning to predict early signs of cardiac arrest in newborn babies based on vital signs like heart rate and oxygen saturation. Models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks are applied to improve early diagnosis and support neonatal care.
